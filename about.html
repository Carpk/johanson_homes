        <p>Charles Johanson, owner/President, has been in the construction industry his entire life, following in the footsteps of his Grandfather who immigrated from Sweden, passing his love of creating works of art on to his grandson. Charlie studied art at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. He and his wife Kathy moved to Florida in 1980 and started building one of a kind custom homes shortly after. He saw a need for a company that would build between 1 and 2 homes at a time, thus giving each client the personalized supervision and attention to detail they deserve.
