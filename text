Having built some of the most exclusive high tech. custom homes on Jupiter Island and the Treasure Coast, we have built a reputation that only a few have mastered.

Charles Johanson, owner/President, has been in the construction industry his entire life, following in the footsteps of his Grandfather who immigrated from Sweden, passing his love of creating works of art on to his grandson. Charlie studied art at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. He and his wife Kathy moved to Florida in 1980 and started building one of a kind custom homes shortly after. He saw a need for a company that would build between 1 and 2 homes at a time, thus giving each client the personalized supervision and attention to detail they deserve.  Twenty Five years later, Charlie still works alongside his men on a daily basis, thus ensuring the quality and attention to detail numerous clients have come to know.
